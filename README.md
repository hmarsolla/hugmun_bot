Welcome to the WIP HugMun Bot.

This project is starting as a way of practicing Node.js, so there's no defined requirements for this bot. Yet.

I'll try to accomplish some random tasks as they appear before me.
If you want to try it out, you can totally clone it :D

I left a ./settings/token.js file with a "PLACE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" placeholder so you can just put your own Discord API token there and have some fun.

Don't know what a token is? Easy one. Check this URL right here and create yours: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

Anyway, feel free to say anything and ask about anything.

Cheers, let's have some fun coding, shall we?
